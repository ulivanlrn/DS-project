# Analyzing the Hotel Booking Dataset and Developing a Manual ML Pipeline for the Binary Classification Task Using Python
### In this project a binary classification problem in particular dataset is considered. The dataset contains information in tabular form about hotel bookings for three years. The target variable represents the set of 0s and 1s, 1 meaning that the booking got cancelled and 0 meaning the opposite. The objective is making reliable predictions on new data while taking business interests into consideration.
    
### There are two main parts in the project. The first one is all about studying the dataset and may be considered as a preparation stage before the second part. It covers data preprocessing (cleaning and transformation), Exploratory Data Analysis, feature engineering and univariate feature analysis. The second part is called "Model building", where application of two well-known machine learning algorithms, Logistic Regression and RandomForestClassifier, is examined.
